The aim of this thesis is to find the optimal algorithm for content-based multi-label classification of music tracks, that can be solved with minimal training data. In Chapter 3, the state of art models were reviewed and in section \ref{model}, the short-comings of these algorithms in addressing the problems discussed in Chapter 1 (see \ref{problems}) were pointed out. In this chapter, the experiments that will lead to finding the best algorithm using the components short-listed in \ref{model} will be described.
