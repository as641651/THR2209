\section*{Abstract}

Describing music can be quite tricky and talking about music may simply require as much vocabulary as any technical subject. Musicians and composers usually discuss their work with jargons describing certain aesthetics of the song. As the amount of music recordings are constantly growing, finding a song that matches these aesthetic description is challenging. The currently available state-of-art algorithms are trained on datasets that have some linguistic noise, making the signal-semantic mapping unclear. In this thesis, the classifier is trained on a personal repertoire with carefully labelled data attempting to reduce the semantic gap.          

In the following work, content-based multi-label classification algorithms are tested on a repository of clean tags, free from social bias. The machine learning assumption is that if we show an algorithm enough examples, the correlation between human tags and predicted tags will become clear. 
We address the automatic music tagging problem that can be solved by training with a personal repertoire. Trying to convey the meaning of music or its emotional content is not an easy task. This leaves a  semantic gap between music audio and listener's choice of words to describe the aspects of music. Furthermore, some emotional and structural components of music are realized only after listening to a greater length of the song. Hence we address the problem of multi-label classification on features that approximates the whole song. Since personal repertoires are usually small, we stick to find solutions on a medium sized dataset. We use convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for localized feature extraction. These features are extracted every 29s from log-amplitude Mel-spectrogram and fed into sequence-to-one recurrent neural network for temporal summarization of the song, which are then used for classification. We finetune over CNN architectures in \cite{choi_cnn} \cite{choi_crnn} and report the categorical AUC scores and Mean average precision. We also report the variations in performance with increasing number of training labels. [TODO : findings]
