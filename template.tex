\section*{Abstract}

Describing music can be quite tricky and talking about music may simply require as much vocabulary as any technical subject. This makes analysing music and communicating it's musical syntax challenging. An algorithm that  automate the task of attaching a semantic description to a song should extract relevant features from the audio signal for optimum performance.
Supervised feature learning is used to obtain features that could be optimum for our context of music tagging. Convolution Neural Networks(CNN) and Sequence to One Long-Short Term Memory(LSTM) Recurrent neural networks are used to induct supervised learning into the feature extraction pipeline. A repertoire of 842 songs with carefully labelled data is used for training. Since our target dataset is small, the model is first trained on \textit{MagnaTagATune}(MTT) public dataset. The performance of transfer learning with CNN and LSTM are compared for different levels of supervised fine-tuning in the feature extraction pipeline and the Weighted averaged Area Under receiver operating characteristic Curve (WAUC) scores are reported. It has been found that the performance of CNN and LSTM, when fine-tuned on target dataset, is better than the corresponding models trained on MTT dataset used as black-box feature extractors for target task. These models are also compared with Mel-Frequency-Cepstral-coefficient(MFCC) features approximated by Bag of Frames algorithm which does not require labelled data. The performance with features extracted by fine-tuned CNN is lesser than MFCCs for our target task.

\section*{\bf Acknowledgments}
I would like to thank \textit{Prof. Paolo Bientinesi} (High performance and automatic computing group, AICES, RWTH Aachen) for doing one of the most expensive work - \textit{Listen to the songs and tag them}. I also thank  \textit{Prof. Marco Alunno} (Professor of Composition and Theory at University EAFIT, Columbia) for his valuable association and advices.
