\section*{Abstract}

We address the automatic music tagging problem that can be solved by training with a personal repertoire. Trying to convey the meaning of music or its emotional content is not an easy task. This leaves a  semantic gap between music audio and listener's choice of words to describe the aspects of music. Furthermore, some emotional and structural components of music are realized only after listening to a greater length of the song. Hence we address the problem of multi-label classification on features that approximates the whole song. Since personal repertoires are usually small, we stick to find solutions on a medium sized dataset. We use convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for localized feature extraction. These features are extracted every 29s from log-amplitude Mel-spectrogram and fed into sequence-to-one recurrent neural network for temporal summarization of the song, which are then used for classification. We finetune over CNN architectures in \cite{choi_cnn} \cite{choi_crnn} and report the categorical AUC scores and Mean average precision. We also report the variations in performance with increasing number of training labels. [TODO : findings]
